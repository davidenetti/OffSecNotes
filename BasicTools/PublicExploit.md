Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with exploit to see if we get any results.

A well-known tool for this purpose is searchsploit, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command:
`sudo apt install exploitdb -y`

Then, we can use searchsploit to search for a specific application by its name, as follows:
`searchsploit openssh 7.2`


We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like Exploit DB, Rapid7 DB, or Vulnerability Lab.

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like:

- Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets;
- Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target;
- Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets;
- Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools.
